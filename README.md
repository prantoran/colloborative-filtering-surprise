#### Two types of recommender systems:
- Content-Based
-- Focus on the attributes of the items to recommend items
- Collaborative Filtering
-- Produces recommendations based on the knowledge of the users' attitudes to items
#### Collaborative filtering:
- able to do feature learning on its own, i.e. which features to use.
##### Divided into two categories:
- Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Model-Based Collaborative Filtering
###### MemoryBCF
####### Two main sections:
- user-item filtering
- item-item filtering


##### Implementations:
- ModelBCF using singular value decomposition (SVD)
- MemoryBCF by computing cosine-similarity
